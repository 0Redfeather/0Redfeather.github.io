    <h1>Project Description</h1>
      <p> Meandering around a museum and really taking in all of the art work and exhibits may work for some visitors, but at times can become an overwhelming experience for others. Vasa Visitor Lifeboat 
      App offers an experience for visitors who are interested in certain exhibits or have a limited amount of time to see what the museum has to offer. This app caters to visitors by 
      crowdsourcing the preferences of other museum visitors like them who have already experienced the exhibits. We will accomplish this by allowing visitors to select categories that apply to them 
      and allows for them to then vote and give feedback on their favorite exhibits. Future visitors will then be given a tailored selection of 
      exhibits to visit based on the results from previous visitors who have visited the museum and voted on categories of interest to them. </p>
