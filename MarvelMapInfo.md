This file contains the info for our Marvel Map

Our Goals:

  Develop a Narrative: Origins of Marvel Heroes and possibly Villains in New York City
  Create a web page displaying a map of locations for those origins
    Title with description of the narrative
    edge to edge map (no margin)
    15 places of memory
        Custom marker with custom interactive popup with name, image (open source), and link to wiki
    Custom basemap
    Files must be on Github Repository and published with GitHub Pages
    Extra points for using front end framework (Bootstrap)
    Super extra points for building a way to toggle between sites of memory in some way.
