Our Goals:

  Create a web page displaying a map of locations for those origins
    -Title with description of the narrative
    -edge to edge map (no margin)
    -15 places of memory
        -Custom marker - custom interactive popup with name, image (open source), and link to wiki
    -Custom basemap
    -Files must be on Github Repository and published with GitHub Pages
    -Extra points for using front end framework (Bootstrap)
    -Super extra points for building a way to toggle between sites of memory in some way.
